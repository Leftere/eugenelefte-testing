These included cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events. The incidence of AOEs in OPTIC (45 mg → 15 mg) was 13% of 94 patients; 5% experienced Grade 3 or 4. In PACE, the incidence of AOEs was 26% of 449 patients; 14% experienced Grade 3 or 4. Fatal AOEs occurred in 2.1% of patients in OPTIC, and in 2% of patients in PACE. Some patients in PACE experienced recurrent or multisite vascular occlusion. Patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors, including patients age 50 years or younger, experienced these events. The most common risk factors observed with these events in PACE were history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and non-ischemic cardiac disease. In OPTIC and PACE, AOEs were more frequent with increasing age. <p>In OPTIC, patients with uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease were excluded. In PACE, patients with uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and patients with clinically significant or active cardiovascular disease within the 3 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG were excluded. Consider whether the benefits of ICLUSIG are expected to exceed the risks.</p><p>Monitor for evidence of AOEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity. Consider benefit-risk to guide a decision to restart ICLUSIG.</p><h3>Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs):</h3> <p>Serious or severe VTEs have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PACE, VTEs occurred in 6% of 449 patients including serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) VTEs in 5.8% of patients. VTEs included deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal vein thrombosis with vision loss. The incidence was higher in patients with Ph+ ALL (9% of 32 patients) and BP‑CML (10% of 62 patients). One of 94 patients in OPTIC experienced a VTE (Grade 1 retinal vein occlusion). Monitor for evidence of VTEs. Interrupt, then resume at the same or decreased dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.</p><h3>Heart Failure:</h3> <p>Fatal, serious or severe heart failure events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PACE, heart failure occurred in 9% of 449 patients; 7% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or higher). Heart failure occurred in 12% of 94 patients in OPTIC; 1.1% experienced serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4). In PACE, the most frequently reported heart failure events (≥2%) were congestive cardiac failure (3.1%), decreased ejection fraction (2.9%), and cardiac failure (2%). In OPTIC, the most frequently reported heart failure events (>1 patient each) were left ventricular hypertrophy (2.1%) and BNP increased (2.1%). Monitor patients for signs or symptoms consistent with heart failure and manage heart failure as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG for new or worsening heart failure.</p><h3>Hepatotoxicity:</h3> <p>ICLUSIG can cause hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Fulminant hepatic failure leading to death occurred in 3 patients, with hepatic failure occurring within 1 week of starting ICLUSIG in one of these patients. These fatal cases occurred in patients with BP‑CML or Ph+ ALL. Hepatotoxicity occurred in 25% of 94 patients in OPTIC and 32% of 449 patients in PACE. Grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity occurred in OPTIC (6% of 94 patients) and PACE (13% of 449 patients). The most frequent hepatotoxic events were elevations of ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Monitor liver function tests at baseline, then at least monthly or as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at a reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.</p><h3>Hypertension:</h3> <p>Serious or severe hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Patients may require urgent clinical intervention for hypertension associated with confusion, headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Monitor blood pressure at baseline and as clinically indicated and manage hypertension as clinically indicated. Interrupt, dose reduce, or stop ICLUSIG if hypertension is not medically controlled. For significant worsening, labile or treatment‑resistant hypertension, interrupt ICLUSIG and consider evaluating for renal artery stenosis.</p> <h3>Pancreatitis:</h3> <p>Serious or severe pancreatitis has occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Elevations of lipase and amylase also occurred. In the majority of cases that led to dose modification or treatment discontinuation, pancreatitis resolved within 2 weeks. Monitor serum lipase every 2 weeks for the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter or as clinically indicated. Consider additional serum lipase monitoring in patients with a history of pancreatitis or alcohol abuse. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on severity. Evaluate for pancreatitis when lipase elevation is accompanied by abdominal symptoms.</p><h3>Increased Toxicity in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Phase CML:</h3> <p>In a prospective randomized clinical trial in the first line treatment of newly diagnosed patients with CP‑CML, single agent ICLUSIG 45 mg once daily increased the risk of serious adverse reactions 2‑fold compared to single agent imatinib 400 mg once daily. The median exposure to treatment was less than 6 months. The trial was halted for safety. Arterial and venous thrombosis and occlusions occurred at least twice as frequently in the ICLUSIG arm compared to the imatinib arm. Compared to imatinib-treated patients, ICLUSIG-treated patients exhibited a greater incidence of myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, cardiac failure, hypertension, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. ICLUSIG is not indicated and is not recommended for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CP‑CML.</p><h3>Neuropathy:</h3> <p>Peripheral and cranial neuropathy occurred in patients in OPTIC and PACE. Some of these events in PACE were Grade 3 or 4. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or weakness. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.</p>><h3>Ocular Toxicity:</h3> <p>Serious or severe ocular toxicity leading to blindness or blurred vision have occurred in ICLUSIG-treated patients. The most frequent ocular toxicities occurring in OPTIC and PACE were dry eye, blurred vision, and eye pain. Retinal toxicities included age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous floaters. Conduct comprehensive eye exams at baseline and periodically during treatment.</p><h3>Hemorrhage:</h3> <p>Fatal and serious hemorrhage events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. Fatal hemorrhages occurred in PACE and serious hemorrhages occurred in OPTIC and PACE. The incidence of serious bleeding events was higher in patients with AP‑CML, BP‑CML, and Ph+ ALL. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage and subdural hematoma were the most frequently reported serious hemorrhages. Events often occurred in patients with Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Monitor for hemorrhage and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.</p><h3>Fluid Retention:</h3> <p>Fatal and serious fluid retention events have occurred in patients who received ICLUSIG. In PACE, one instance of brain edema was fatal and serious events included pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and angioedema. Monitor for fluid retention and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.</p><h3>Cardiac Arrhythmias:</h3> <p>Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, occurred in patients in OPTIC and PACE. For some patients, events were serious or severe (Grade 3 or 4) and led to hospitalization. Monitor for signs and symptoms suggestive of slow heart rate (fainting, dizziness) or rapid heart rate (chest pain, palpitations or dizziness) and manage patients as clinically indicated. Interrupt, then resume at the same or reduced dose or discontinue ICLUSIG based on recurrence/severity.</p><h3>Myelosuppression:</h3> <p>Grade 3 or 4 events of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in patients in OPTIC and PACE. The incidence of myelosuppression was greater in patients with AP‑CML, BP‑CML, and Ph+ ALL than in patients with CP‑CML. Obtain complete blood counts every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and then monthly or as clinically indicated. If ANC less than 1 x 109/L or platelets less than 50 x 109/L, interrupt ICLUSIG until ANC at least 1.5 x 109/L and platelets at least 75 x 109/L, then resume at same or reduced dose.</p><h3>Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS):</h3> <p>Serious TLS was reported in ICLUSIG-treated patients in OPTIC and PACE. Ensure adequate hydration and treat high uric acid levels prior to initiating ICLUSIG.</p><h3>Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS):</h3> <p>RPLS (also known as Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been reported in patients who received ICLUSIG. Along with neurological signs and symptoms, hypertension may be present. Diagnosis is made with supportive findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Interrupt ICLUSIG until resolution. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG in patients upon resolution of RPLS is unknown.</p><h3>Impaired Wound Healing and Gastrointestinal Perforation:</h3> <p>Impaired wound healing occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Withhold ICLUSIG for at least 1 week prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. The safety of resumption of ICLUSIG after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula occurred in patients receiving ICLUSIG. Permanently discontinue in patients with gastrointestinal perforation.</p><h3>Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:</h3> <p>Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, ICLUSIG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, adverse developmental effects occurred at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 3 weeks after the last dose.</p><h3>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h3><p>The most common (>20%) adverse reactions are rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, dry skin, hypertension, fatigue, fluid retention and edema, pyrexia, nausea, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, hemorrhage, anemia, hepatic dysfunction and AOEs. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>20%) are platelet count decreased, neutrophil cell count decreased, and white blood cell decreased.</p><p><strong>To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. at 1‑844‑817‑6468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.</strong></p><h3>DRUG INTERACTIONS:</h3><p><strong><span><u>Strong CYP3A Inhibitors:</u></span></strong> Avoid coadministration or reduce ICLUSIG dose if coadministration cannot be avoided.<br /> <strong><span><u>Strong CYP3A Inducers:</u></span></strong> Avoid coadministration.</p><h3>USE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS</h3><p><strong><span>Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:</span></strong> Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ICLUSIG.<br /> Ponatinib may impair fertility in females, and it is not known if these effects are reversible.</p><p><strong><span>Lactation:</span></strong> Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ICLUSIG and for 6 days following last dose.</p>"
